## Translations
Translations are managed with [lingui](https://lingui.dev). 

To translate a new text:

* Run `npm run extract` to add new translation keys to all `messages.po` files under `src/locales`
* Update the translations in each `messages.po`
* Run `npm run compile` to update the `message.ts` files with latest translations

To add a new language:
* Add the new locale in `lingui.config.js` locales
* Run `npm run extract` to create `src/locales/{your-locale}/messages.po`
* Fill your translations into that file & run `npm run compile`
* Add your new locale to `loadTranslations` in `src/lib/utils.ts`
