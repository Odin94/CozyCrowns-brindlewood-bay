## How to run
* `npm isntall` (yes, *isntall*)
* `npm run dev` to start dev server
* `npm run build` to generate production build


## Fonts
* CozyCrowns uses fonts from [google fonts](https://fonts.google.com) that were tranformed into woff2 for effiency with [ttf2woff2](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ttf2woff2)


## Translations
Translations are managed with [lingui](https://lingui.dev). 

To translate a new text:
* Wrap it in either the `<Trans>` macro component or use the `t` macro for text outside of components
* Run `npm run extract` to add new translation keys to all `messages.po` files under `src/locales`
* Update the translations in each `messages.po`. The vite plugin will automatically load them, but you can also load them manually during build time with `npm run compile`

To add a new language:
* Add the new locale in `lingui.config.js` locales

## Analytics
* CozyCrowns uses [posthog](https://posthog.com) for analytics
* Create a `.env` file based on `.env.sample` to enable analytics with your API key
